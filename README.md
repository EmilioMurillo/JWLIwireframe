# JWLIwireframe
This is a mock up of a client website I built.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I was getting comfortable with building and desinging different kinds of sections in a website. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was the one of the first times I have ever built something real. A client webiste that needed to be done as soon as possible. They handed over the wireframes and I had to build as fast as possible. I was able to build this wireframe in one day to a pixel perfect level. It was a very proud moment for me as a developer. Having no prior experience in doing such a thing.
